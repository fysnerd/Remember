## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: ESM migration required by AdminJS v7+ (no alternative)
- Phase 1: Pino chosen for structured logging (5x faster than Winston)
- Phase 2: JobExecution model in Supabase for persistent job history (survives PM2 restarts)
- Phase 3: Hardcoded admin credentials for single-user access (solo dev, sufficient for now)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 risk:** ESM migration is codebase-wide breaking change. All 11 cron jobs, OAuth flows, and API endpoints must be tested after migration. Dependency audit for ESM compatibility needed before starting.

**Phase 4 complexity:** AdminJS custom dashboard pattern (ComponentLoader) has sparse documentation. Fallback option (standalone HTML + Chart.js) available if needed.
